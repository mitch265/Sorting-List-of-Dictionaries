# Sorting-List-of-Dictionaries
How to sort a list of dictionaries in Python, based on values not explicitly in the list or dict key-val pairs.

The dicts in the list is sorted using the formula [review score/distance from the point coordinate].

Certain dicts don't have review scores. For those, I set the review score to '0' to make the math easier.
You may have a better way to do it, so feel free to experiment.
